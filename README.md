# ICET

This repository contains code for our Iterative Closest Ellipsoidal Transform (ICET) point cloud registration algorithm. Code is structured in a ROS package to demonstrate real-time HD Map generation. Also included is a jupyter notebook with inline 3D visualization so our algorithm can be tested without needing to set up a ROS enviornment on your machine.
